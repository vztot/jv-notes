## java-history-and-philosophy

### History

Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. The first public implementation was Java 1.0 in 1995. It made the promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere", with free runtimes on popular platforms. It was fairly secure and its security was configurable, allowing for network and file access to be limited. The major web browsers soon incorporated it into their standard configurations in a secure "applet" configuration. popular quickly. New versions for large and small platforms (J2EE and J2ME) soon were designed with the advent of "Java 2". Sun has not announced any plans for a "Java 3".

### Philosophy

There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
1. It should use the object-oriented programming methodology.
2. It should allow the same program to be executed on multiple operating systems.
3. It should contain built-in support for using computer networks.
4. It should be designed to execute code from remote sources securely.
5. It should be easy to use by selecting what was considered the good parts of other object-oriented languages.

## primitives

**They're stored on the stack.**

The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, and char â€“ those aren't considered objects and represent raw values:


```
// integer types
boolean bool = true;        // boolean size is virtual machine dependent
byte b = 127;               // 1 byte; from -128 to 127 
short s = 1123;             // 2 byte; from -32768 to 32767
char c = 65;                // 2 bytes; from -32768 to 32767; is similar to "char c = 'A';" and "char c = 65 + 32;" is similar to "char c = 'a';"  
int i = 2_000_000_000;      // 4 bytes; from -2147483648 to 2147483647; u can use "_" whenever except of ending and begining
long l = 12321312321312L;   // 8 bytes; from -9223372036854775808L to 9223372036854775807L; postfix "L" or "l" mean literals of type long; we use upper-case because of Google Style

// float pointing types
float f = 17.08F;           // 4 bytes; from 1.4e-45f to 3.4e+38f always with "F" or "f" at the end.
double d = 77.99;           // 8 bytes; from 4.9e-324 to 1.7e+308; java double is IEEE 754 standard comliant

// some other notations
int k = 0b111010;           // binary notation
int m = 012;                // octal notation
int n = 0xCAFE;             // hexadecimal notation
long l = 0xCAFE_DEAL;        // hexadecimal with literal
```

## wrappers

**They're stored in the heap.**

Wrapper classes are objects encapsulating primitive Java types. Each Java primitive has a corresponding wrapper.
Basically, generic classes only work with objects and don't support primitives. As a result, if we want to work with them, we have to convert primitive values into wrapper objects.

Other source says that wrappers was created because data structures in java (ArrayList, HashMap etc.) can store only the objects and plus the object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.

Wrapper initialization:

```
Boolean b = true;
Short s = 32_000;
Character c = 'c';
Integer i = 0b00001;
Long l = 12312321211L;
Float f = 1212.2f;
```

## conversions

### Primitive to Primitive Conversions

When we need to convert from a primitive that is simpler or smaller than the destination type, we don't have to use any special notation for that
```
int myInt = 127;
long myLong = myInt;
```
During widening conversion, the smaller primitive value is placed over a larger container, which means that all the extra space, on the left of the value, is filled with zeros. This may also be used to go from the integer group to the floating point

```
float myFloat = myLong;
double myDouble = myLong;
```
This is possible because the moving to a wider primitive does not lose any information.

Sometimes we need to fit a value that is larger than the type used in the variable declaration. This may result in information loss since some bytes will have to be discarded.

In this case, we have to explicitly express that we are aware of the situation and we agree with that, by using a cast:


```
int myInt = (int) myDouble;
byte myByte = (byte) myInt;
```

### Primitive to Wrapper Class Conversions

We can either use constructor or static factory methods to convert a primitive value to an object of a wrapper class

```
Integer object = new Integer(1);
Integer anotherObject = Integer.valueOf(1);

int a = object.intValue();
int b = anotherObject.intValue();
```

## autoboxing-and-unboxing

**After Java 5**. Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the
 primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.
 
 Here is the simplest example of autoboxing:
```
Character ch = 'a';
```

And another one:

```
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < 50; i += 2) {
            list.add(i);
        }
```

Thus, the compiler converts the previous code to the following at runtime:

```
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
       for (int i = 1; i < 50; i += 2) {
           list.add(Integer.valueOf(i));
       }
```

Converting a primitive value (an int, for example) into an object of the corresponding wrapper class (Integer) is called autoboxing. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:

* Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.
* Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class.

Unboxing example:

```java
public class Unboxing {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
        Integer i = new Integer(-8);
 
        // 1. Unboxing through method invocation
        int absVal = absoluteValue(i);
        System.out.println("absolute value of " + i + " = " + absVal);
 
        List<Double> ld = new ArrayList<>();
        ld.add(3.1416);    // PI is autoboxed through method invocation.
 
        // 2. Unboxing through assignment
        double phi = ld.get(0);
        System.out.println("phi = " + phi);
    }
 
    public static int absoluteValue(int i) {
        return (i < 0) ? -i : i;
    }
}
```

### Arrays

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 
The length of an array is established when the array is created. 
After creation, its length is fixed.

Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Array:
```
byte[] anArrayOfBytes;
short[] anArrayOfShorts;
long[] anArrayOfLongs;
float[] anArrayOfFloats;
double[] anArrayOfDoubles;
boolean[] anArrayOfBooleans;
char[] anArrayOfChars;
String[] anArrayOfStrings;
```
You can also place the brackets after the array's name:
```
// this form is discouraged
float anArrayOfFloats[];
```
However, convention discourages this form; the brackets identify the array type and should 
appear with the type designation.

Creating:
```
int[] anArray = new int[10];
anArray[0] = 100; // initialize first element
anArray[1] = 200; // initialize second element
anArray[2] = 300; // and so forth
```

Alternatively, you can use the shortcut syntax to create and initialize an array:

```
int[] anArray = { 
    100, 200, 300,
    400, 500, 600, 
    700, 800, 900, 1000
};
```

Copying Arrays:

The System class has an arraycopy method that you can use to efficiently
 copy data from one array into another:

```java
class ArrayCopyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] copyFrom = { 'd', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'e',
			    'i', 'n', 'a', 't', 'e', 'd' };
        char[] copyTo = new char[7];

        System.arraycopy(copyFrom, 2, copyTo, 0, 7);
        System.out.println(new String(copyTo));
    }
}
```

Some other useful operations provided by methods in the java.util.Arrays class, are:

* Searching an array for a specific value to get the index at which it is placed 
(the binarySearch method).
* Comparing two arrays to determine if they are equal or not (the equals method).
* Filling an array to place a specific value at each index (the fill method).
* Sorting an array into ascending order. This can be done either sequentially, 
using the sort method, or concurrently, using the parallelSort method introduced in Java SE 8.
 Parallel sorting of large arrays on multiprocessor systems is faster than sequential array sorting.
